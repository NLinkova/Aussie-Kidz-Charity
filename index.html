  <blockquote>“We are forever grateful to Aussie Kidz for their continued support with our three-year
    old twin boys. Through the generosity of this organisation and others like it, our boys were able 
    to have SDR in America and have the equipment to support them upon returning home. More than anything,
     your assistance and support gave us hope. Hope that our boys could have the best possible treatment and
     hope that our boys could walk. Our boys will have more opportunities and will live a better life thanks 
     to Aussie Kidz. Thank you Sharon.” Grant Recipient - Ben & William</blockquote>

    <h2>About Us & What We do</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Aussie Kidz Charity assists the families of children under the age of 18 years old that are diagnosed
        with a disability.<br>After years of supporting various well known kids charities, Aussie Kidz Charity was
        started in early 2000 by a group of individuals disheartened by watching an increasing percentage of 
        donations being used to cover overheads instead of going to the ones who need it most, the Kids.

      <p>With Aussie Kidz Charity, 100% of the donations received are used for the children, with the running
        costs and overheads kept to an absolute minimum and looked after by the Directors and friends.<br> Since 
        starting, we have raised over $750,000 and have provided over 150 grants covering mobility aids, walking
        frames, specialised clothing and other assistance to these very special kids.

      <p>We are focussing on gaining support and donations through the generosity of Directors, individuals,
